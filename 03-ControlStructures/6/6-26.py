# The payment card is secured with a four-digit PIN code (0805). 
# Write a program that checks if the PIN code entered in the payment terminal is correct.

# In case of three unsuccessful attempts, the card is blocked. 
# Sample result:
# Enter the PIN code: 2398
# Incorrect...
# Enter the PIN code: 0912
# Incorrect...
# Enter the PIN code: 7860
# Incorrect...
# Sorry, your payment card has been blocked.
